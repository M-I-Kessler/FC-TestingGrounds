#FC-p5js-TestingGrounds

The goal of this project is:
  1. To port (not necessarily a complete port) the FC (FadeCandy) OPC (Open Pixel Control) and FC sketches written in Processing Java 
  to Processing JavaScript (P5js).
  2. Write additional sketches used via OPC.
  3. To allow remote testing of FadeCandy servers via a webpage using P5js.
  
  
Sketches written should in P5js should not have a large canvas as this can dramatically affect rendering times to an FC server.
